    * Simplified version of CNCF
    * Other approach - each WG lead is member of TAC, makes size of TAC unbounded, creates incentive to restrict new WGs, etc.
    * Discussion about # of members - is 7 too big, too small
        * Bigger - difficult to coordinate (quorum requirement)
        * TAC should be working on oversight, most of the work should be done in the WGs/Projects)
    * How do we identify â€˜contributors to technical projectsâ€™
        * Kubernetes does this by identifying individuals who have had activity on a project (created issue, commented on issue, etc.)
        * Another project - â€˜measurable contributionâ€™ = â€˜commitâ€™
        * Exception process for people have contributed documentation (e.g. for wiki pages)
        * Attended x # of meetings, committer
    * Next step:
        * David/Lindsay to send the proposal to Mike Dolan for review, make sure the rules regarding voting are OK. Potential issue about limitation to x # of members (1 or 2) per organization
            * David send email after this call to understand rules, guidelines, issues, constraints.
        * One more pass at proposal to accomplish the following:
            * Clarify process for identifying â€˜contributors of technical projectsâ€™
            * Add statement about # of TAC members per organization (David will research)
        * Discuss (and possibly vote) at next meeting (January 12)
    * Must be filled by February
